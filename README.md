🐍 Python Mini Projects Collection

A well-structured collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python programs built to strengthen core programming concepts and logical thinking.

This repository focuses not just on writing code — but on understanding the logic behind it.

📂 Project Structure
🔢 Number Based Programs
1️⃣ Number System Functions

Logic:
This program converts numbers between binary, octal, and hexadecimal formats using Python’s built-in conversion functions. It helps understand how different number systems work internally.

2️⃣ Prime Number Checker

Logic:
The program checks if a number is divisible only by 1 and itself.
It runs a loop from 2 to √n to efficiently check divisibility.
If any number divides it completely → it’s not prime.

3️⃣ Factorial Calculator

Logic:
Calculates factorial using a loop or recursion.
Factorial = multiplication of numbers from 1 to n.
Used to understand loops and recursion concepts.

4️⃣ Fibonacci Generator

Logic:
Generates Fibonacci sequence where:
next number = sum of previous two numbers
Uses iteration to store and update values step by step.

5️⃣ Armstrong Number Checker

Logic:
Separates digits of a number, raises each digit to the power of total digits, and checks if their sum equals the original number.

Example:
153 → 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153 ✔

6️⃣ Perfect Number Checker

Logic:
Finds all divisors of a number (excluding itself).
If the sum of divisors equals the number → Perfect number.

Example:
6 → 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 ✔

7️⃣ GCD & LCM Calculator

Logic:
Uses:

Euclidean Algorithm for GCD

Formula: LCM = (a × b) / GCD

Helps understand mathematical optimization.

8️⃣ Sum & Average Calculator

Logic:
Takes multiple inputs, stores them in a list, calculates:

Sum using loop or built-in sum()

Average = sum / count

9️⃣ Multiplication Table

Logic:
Uses loop from 1–10 and multiplies each value with the given number.

🧠 Logic & Games
🎮 Number Guessing Game

Logic:

Generates random number using random module

User keeps guessing

Program gives hints: “Too High” / “Too Low”

Loop continues until correct guess

Demonstrates loops, conditions, and randomness.

🏦 ATM Simulator

Logic:

Menu-driven system

Options: Withdraw, Deposit, Check Balance

Uses conditional statements

Prevents withdrawal if balance insufficient

Simulates real-world banking logic.

🎟️ Ticket Pricing System

Logic:
Ticket price changes based on:

Age category

Student status

Discount rules

Demonstrates decision-making logic using if-else.

📊 Utility Applications
💰 Bill Splitter

Logic:

Takes total bill amount

Divides among number of people

Optional tip percentage calculation

Useful real-life application.

🎂 Age Calculator

Logic:
Uses datetime module

Takes birthdate

Calculates difference between current date and birthdate

Displays age in years/months/days

🌡️ Temperature Converter

Logic:
Uses formula-based conversion:

Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit

Fahrenheit ↔ Kelvin

Simple formula-based conditional conversion.

🏆 Grade Calculator

Logic:

Takes marks

Calculates percentage

Assigns grade based on range conditions

Example:
90+ → A
75–89 → B

🔤 String & Text Processing
📖 Text Analysis Functions

Logic:
Analyzes:

Word count

Character count

Vowel count

Uppercase/lowercase letters

Uses loops and string methods.

✂ String Manipulator

Logic:
Performs:

Reverse string

Change case

Remove spaces

Replace words

Helps practice built-in string functions.

🔁 Palindrome Checker

Logic:
Checks whether string equals its reverse.
Uses slicing: text[::-1]

Example:
“madam” → same forward and backward ✔

🧮 Calculator Programs
➕ Simple Calculator

Logic:
Performs basic arithmetic:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Uses conditional statements.

🧠 Function-Based Calculator

Logic:
Each operation written as separate function.
Demonstrates modular programming and code reusability.
