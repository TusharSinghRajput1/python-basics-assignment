🧠 Logic Behind Each Program

This section briefly explains the core logic used in each program to demonstrate problem-solving approach and understanding.

🔢 Number Based Programs
🔹 Number System Functions

Uses Python’s built-in conversion functions (bin(), oct(), hex()) to convert numbers between different number systems. Helps understand how decimal numbers are represented internally in other formats.

🔹 Prime Number Checker

Checks divisibility from 2 to √n.
If any number divides it completely → it is not prime.
Using √n reduces unnecessary checks and improves efficiency.

🔹 Factorial Calculator

Multiplies numbers from 1 to n using a loop (or recursion).
Demonstrates iterative thinking and understanding of mathematical growth.

🔹 Fibonacci Generator

Starts with 0 and 1.
Each next number = sum of previous two numbers.
Uses loop and variable updates to generate sequence dynamically.

🔹 Armstrong Number Checker

Extracts each digit using modulus and division.
Raises each digit to the power of total digits and sums them.
If sum equals original number → Armstrong number.

🔹 Perfect Number Checker

Finds all proper divisors (excluding the number itself).
If their sum equals the number → Perfect number.

🔹 GCD & LCM Calculator

Uses Euclidean Algorithm for GCD (repeated remainder method).
LCM calculated using formula:
LCM = (a × b) / GCD

🔹 Sum & Average Calculator

Stores numbers in a list.
Calculates sum using loop or built-in function.
Average = total sum ÷ number of elements.

🔹 Multiplication Table

Uses a loop from 1 to 10.
Multiplies user input number with loop variable.

🧠 Logic & Games
🎮 Number Guessing Game

Generates random number using random module.
User guesses until correct.
Program gives hints like “Too High” or “Too Low”.
Demonstrates loops and conditional flow control.

🏦 ATM Simulator

Menu-driven system using while loop.
Options handled using conditional statements.
Ensures withdrawal does not exceed balance.
Simulates basic banking logic.

🎟️ Ticket Pricing System

Uses conditional branching to calculate ticket cost based on age and discount rules.
Demonstrates real-world decision-making logic.

📊 Utility Applications
💰 Bill Splitter

Divides total bill amount by number of people.
Optionally adds tip percentage before splitting.

🎂 Age Calculator

Uses datetime module to calculate difference between current date and birth date.
Converts difference into years, months, or days.

🌡️ Temperature Converter

Applies mathematical formulas for conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
Uses conditional statements for selected conversion type.

🏆 Grade Calculator

Calculates percentage from total marks.
Assigns grade based on predefined ranges using if-elif conditions.

🔤 String & Text Processing
📖 Text Analysis Functions

Counts words, characters, vowels, and case types using loops and string methods.
Demonstrates string traversal and pattern checking.

✂ String Manipulator

Performs operations like reversing, changing case, replacing words, and trimming spaces using built-in string methods.

🔁 Palindrome Checker

Reverses string using slicing (text[::-1]).
Compares original and reversed string to determine palindrome.

🧮 Calculator Programs
➕ Simple Calculator

Performs arithmetic operations using conditional statements.

🧠 Function-Based Calculator

Each arithmetic operation written as separate function.
Demonstrates modular programming and code reusability.

👤 Personal Bio Card

Takes user input and formats it using string formatting.
Focuses on structured output presentation.
