# 🧠 Logic Behind Each Program  

This section explains the core logic used in each program to demonstrate structured thinking and implementation skills.

---

## 🔢 Number Based Programs  

### 🔹 Number System Functions  
Uses Python’s built-in conversion functions (`bin()`, `oct()`, `hex()`) to convert numbers between decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal formats.

---

### 🔹 Prime Number Checker  
Checks divisibility from 2 to √n.  
If any number divides the input completely, it is not prime.  
Using √n improves efficiency by reducing unnecessary checks.

---

### 🔹 Factorial Calculator  
Calculates factorial by multiplying numbers from 1 to n using loops or recursion.  
Demonstrates understanding of iteration and mathematical growth.

---

### 🔹 Fibonacci Generator  
Starts with 0 and 1.  
Each next number is the sum of the previous two numbers.  
Uses loop-based updating of variables.

---

### 🔹 Armstrong Number Checker  
Extracts digits using modulus and division operations.  
Raises each digit to the power of total digits and compares sum with original number.

---

### 🔹 Perfect Number Checker  
Finds all proper divisors of a number.  
If the sum of divisors equals the number, it is a perfect number.

---

### 🔹 GCD & LCM Calculator  
Uses Euclidean Algorithm to calculate GCD.  
LCM is calculated using:  

LCM = (a × b) / GCD  

---

### 🔹 Sum & Average Calculator  
Stores numbers in a list.  
Calculates total using loop or built-in sum() function.  
Average = total sum / count of numbers.

---

### 🔹 Multiplication Table  
Uses a loop from 1 to 10 and multiplies each value with the given number.

---

## 🧠 Logic & Games  

### 🎮 Number Guessing Game  
Generates a random number using the `random` module.  
User keeps guessing until correct.  
Program provides hints like “Too High” or “Too Low”.

---

### 🏦 ATM Simulator  
Menu-driven system using a while loop.  
Handles withdrawal, deposit, and balance checking.  
Ensures withdrawal does not exceed available balance.

---

### 🎟️ Ticket Pricing System  
Calculates ticket price based on age categories and discount rules using conditional statements.

---

## 📊 Utility Applications  

### 💰 Bill Splitter  
Divides total bill amount among number of people.  
Optionally adds tip percentage before splitting.

---

### 🎂 Age Calculator  
Uses `datetime` module to calculate difference between current date and birth date.  
Displays age in years or total days.

---

### 🌡️ Temperature Converter  
Applies formula-based conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin using conditional logic.

---

### 🏆 Grade Calculator  
Calculates percentage from marks.  
Assigns grades based on predefined ranges using if-elif conditions.

---

## 🔤 String & Text Processing  

### 📖 Text Analysis Functions  
Counts words, characters, vowels, uppercase and lowercase letters using loops and string methods.

---

### ✂ String Manipulator  
Performs operations such as reversing string, changing case, replacing words, and trimming spaces using built-in string functions.

---

### 🔁 Palindrome Checker  
Reverses string using slicing (`text[::-1]`) and compares it with original string to check palindrome.

---

## 🧮 Calculator Programs  

### ➕ Simple Calculator  
Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using conditional branching.

---

### 🧠 Function-Based Calculator  
Each arithmetic operation is implemented as a separate function to demonstrate modular programming and reusability.

---

## 👤 Personal Bio Card  

Takes user input and formats it using structured string formatting for clean output presentation.
